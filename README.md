## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student studying computer engineering and I love to make all sorts of projects, below are some of my personal favourite creations that I've either made on my own or collaborated with. 
Some of these have cool demos, check out [this one](https://hiatus770.github.io/myPage) or [this one](https://hiatus770.github.io/blog/programming/graphics/2024/05/25/Marching-Cubes-and-Metaballs.html)
